# Chapter 4: Practice with forms

## Objectives

* Create a form

### Estimated Completion Time

15 minutes

1. In your `/html` add a file `vball-register.html`.

1. Open the image `vball-form.png` in this directory. It is also pictured here, but opening the file directly may be easier to see.

   ![Open in preview mode to see image](./vball-form.png)

2. Start to create this form in your new HTML file you created. Use the form elements/ controls discussed so far on the slides, and keep the following in mind:
    * There are many elements, try to at least complete one text field, the card type (radio button) and one fieldset
    * Fieldsets have a legend as the first child element - these visually separate sections of a form
    * Ensure each control has a label, name and id value
    * Don't worry too much about formatting, you can surround labels and controls with div for now

3. Choose an element and add the attribute `title` with a value that describes the field - you can then hover over this in the browser for a tool tip type display.

4. Mark your work as complete

## Bonus

1. HTML4 introduced the tabindex to allow keyboards to be used to tab between elements. Check out this document on using tabindex and other accessibility features:     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Keyboard-navigable_JavaScript_widgets

1. Create a form for adding additional recipes.
